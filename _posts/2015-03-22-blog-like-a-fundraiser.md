I don&rsquo;t know what you were doing at 4-years-old, but I certainly wasn&rsquo;t thinking about changing the world. Cosette on the other hand, she&rsquo;s different than most toddlers.

Her heart for making a difference began before most kids can talk. When she learned that many people don&rsquo;t have enough food to eat, she saved up to purchase a cow, sheep and alpaca for someone else through one of our implementing partners, World Vision.

But that wasn&rsquo;t enough.

Good little social entrepreneur that she is, Cosette began talking with her parents about how she could raise even more money. And raise it faster. That&rsquo;s how the idea to sell paintings was born.

Today, Cosette can&rsquo;t paint fast enough to keep up with the demand. She&rsquo;s raised more than $2,400 and still going strong!

When she isn&rsquo;t painting, Cosette enjoys exploring the world, looking for ladybugs, watering her basil plant and hanging with her little bro, Lewis.

Has your heart melted yet?
