Yesterday, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, we welcomed three patients to Moyamba care centre.
All three are doing relatively well. They are able to walk, drink and feed themselves. They’ve arrived in the early stages of infection: we’re lucky. I hope we’ll be able to help them get better. The past few days, in the run-up to the opening, have been extremely intense: exhausting, even. The care centre was like an anthill, with people running around all over the place. 

## An indescribable silence

And then suddenly, when the first ambulance arrived, we all came together in the dressing room to encourage the nurses and hygienists as they put on their PPEs and went into the High Risk Area.
The silence that fell at that moment was indescribable. It was a mixture of emotion, anxiety - and pride, too.
THANK YOU to everyone who helped us get this far.
THANK YOU from the whole team here in Moyamba.
And most importantly, THANK YOU from the people of Moyamba.
