The last three days have been tough for the staff of the ETC. On the 31st of December, we lost our youngest patient, who was only two years old. The team surrounded the body in order to isolate it from the other patients while the burial was organised for the following day.

It was a gruelling experience for everyone: for the other patients as well as for the team who were taking care of them.

## An emotionally charged few days

The same evening, we had tried to organise the rota so that every member of the IPC team - who generally work six-hour shifts - could take an hour or two to celebrate the new year. But the arrival of another ambulance detained them at the ETC: inside was the father of the little girl who had just passed away. Not only was he displaying the symptoms of Ebola, but we had to tell him that his daughter had died.

Luckily, the following day - the first of 2015 - we experienced our most joyful moment since the opening of the centre: we were able to declare our first two patients free of Ebola. The first of the two "survivors" has nine children, and is raising them as a single mother.

Before receiving a "kit" composed of clothes and basic necessities - for safety reasons, patients' possessions have to be burned when they arrive at the centre - the two now ex-patients took a final shower. It’s come to be known as the "Happy Shower", and it’s the last one they’ll take under the supervision of the hygiene team. "No more PPE around this lady!" All the staff on duty yesterday surrounded the two patients, and everyone began to sing and dance, even the older lady, who is nearly 60!

The two women left the centre in a haze of smiles and songs - and a few tears, barely hidden. We thought of our colleagues: those who were here during the first rotation, and all those who have been supporting us from Madrid and Paris. We wished they could have been here to witness this incredible moment.

Sadly, that afternoon, Ebola regained some ground. As the Burial Team went to the cemetery to bury the little girl, a third patient died.

The intense, indescribable joy we had felt that morning seems all the more precious when times are tough. We’re all trying to keep it in mind as we prepare to face the challenges Ebola has in store for us.
