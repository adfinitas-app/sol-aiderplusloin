Since the first of January, we’ve had to deal with a death every day. Sadly, this is nothing out of the ordinary: it simply reflects the standard 50/50 survival rate. The Burial Team have had to bury one body every afternoon, and before they can do so, the hygiene team must move and disinfect the corpse. All of this has to be done quickly, ensuring that the dignity of the deceased is respected, and while protecting the other patients. They are men, women and children of all ages. Some had only just arrived at the centre, while others had been battling the virus for days. It’s impossible to predict who is going to succumb to Ebola, and who is going to get better.

## Keeping people at a distance

At the beginning, we knew every patient by their first name. This made it easy to become attached to them, and created a stronger emotional charge. Now, there are so many patients coming and going that it’s impossible to continue like this. It sounds cold, but it’s important for the team members to create a certain distance if we’re to be able to think clearly when dealing with a difficult situation.

Luckily, there are some days which are better balanced: when we also have patients who are tested negative for Ebola (after three tests). We can then send them on to other health centres for treatment. And the "Happy Showers" keep coming too. Each time, the staff on duty take a couple of minutes to enjoy these moments, which give them the energy to get through the rest of the day. It’s like a breath of fresh air.
