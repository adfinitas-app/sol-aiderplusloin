Since the very first case of Ebola in March 2014, I’ve known that I would go to the field to help fight it. This crisis is completely unjust. Ebola strikes at random. There is no way to treat it, and we’ve got to contain the epidemic. On top of this, there’s the fact that my mother works in Guinea - not directly on the Ebola crisis, but she does have to deal with its effects. So this is very personal for me.

## "Of course I’m scared"

There are many humanitarian aid workers capable of going to work in very difficult contexts - terrible crises, wars, natural disasters - but who won't go to work on the Ebola crisis. There’s a real fear of death, along with the stigma that you face when you get home. I don't blame them. This only motivates me to go "in their stead". I also believe that those who work at Head Office should get involved when there is a real need for human resources. Yes, it is frightening. Of course I'm scared. But it's a healthy fear, not a debilitating fear. It's this fear that ensures I’ll respect the procedures. If I weren't scared, I wouldn't get involved.
