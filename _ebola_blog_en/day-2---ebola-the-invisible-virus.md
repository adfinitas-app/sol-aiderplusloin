Julio has gone to Moyamba, a four-hour drive from Freetown. It’s here that the Ebola care centre is under construction by British Army engineers. It is due for completion at the end of the week. The majority of the structure is already standing, including the "hospital wards", giant tents which can accommodate up to 100 patients; three water tanks of 45m&sup3; each; generators; sanitation facilities; the kitchen; the laundry; and recreational areas for the staff. During the next few days, Julio’s job will be to accompany the British engineers through the final stages of construction in order to ensure that the centre is functional, and that staff, patients and their families will be able to move through it without risk, i.e. while avoiding physical contact and thus the risk of infection. Meanwhile, Andrea has travelled by helicopter to the district of Bo, 240km away, for a training session in an ETC managed by MSF. This is the final stage of the preparation process, during which he will learn to carry out his work – he’ll be responsible for disinfection – under "real-life" conditions, where he’ll be subject to heat, stress, and so on.

As for me, I’m going to Freetown to register SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL with the authorities. It’s amazing how, at first sight, there’s no sign of Ebola. We don’t hear it, and we don’t smell it. I mean yes, there was a temperature check at the airport. We had to wash our hands and have our temperature taken before sitting down to eat at a restaurant yesterday. I saw a poster about Ebola in the city, but for the moment, that’s about it. It’s surprising, when you consider the scale of the crisis, which is affecting the entire country. And it’s particularly strange when you make the comparison with a "standard" humanitarian mission, in a country that’s been torn apart by war or devastated by a natural disaster.

Normally, the impact is immediately obvious. Here, the epidemic is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. At every street corner, we try to catch a glimpse of it; to see the traces it leaves. We try and listen in on conversations about it. But for the moment, there’s nothing. It’s yet another crisis for a country that has already faced, and overcome, so many. Is it that people are trying to be strong and look to the future? Maybe. Or maybe Ebola is more insidious than we’ve been led to believe? We’ll soon see. -
