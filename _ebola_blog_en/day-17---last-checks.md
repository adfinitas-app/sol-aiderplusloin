Tension is mounting in Moyamba. The centre is due to open in just a few hours. We have to check and re-check everything, just as you would in a hospital - except that an Ebola care centre is not a hospital. We need to be a lot more vigilant, and pay attention to the tiniest detail; to the minutest speck of dust. With Ebola, there’s no taking chances. You have to think of a thousand tiny things that might seem inconsequential but in fact are of the utmost importance:

* Protocols and procedures have to be pasted up everywhere - and laminated, since everything is constantly being covered in chlorine.
* Mirrors have to be hung in the dressing room.
* The personal protection suits have to be checked, to make sure they’re sound.
* We have to ensure we have enough specially adapted bins, situated at key points throughout the centre.
* We need to ensure that the body bags are watertight.
* We have to make sure there are enough wooden ‘trees’ so that the hundreds of pairs of boots can dry.
* The centre is equipped with thousands of gowns, pairs of boots, personal protection suits, hair nets, pairs of surgical gloves, pairs of rubber gloves, aprons, masks, bin bags, but also cardboard boxes where sharp items such as syringes can be discarded, body bags...


Even though everyone is on high alert and trying to think of everything, we sometimes notice that we’re missing a bin, or a mirror, or that something’s not working as it should be. Despite it all, we’re feeling confident. When the first patients arrive, we’ll be ready.
