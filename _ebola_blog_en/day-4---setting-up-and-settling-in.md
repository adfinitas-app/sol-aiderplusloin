I’m "on my own" in Freetown. My colleagues, Julio and Andrea, have gone to Moyamba and Bo respectively ([see entry from Day 2](http://aiderplusloin.solidarites.org/en/blog/day%202_ebolathe%20invisiblevirus.html)). Julio is going to continue recruiting the national team and Andrea is in training in a care centre that’s already up and running. I was supposed to go to Moyamba with Julio but because of the living conditions there, I’ve delayed my visit by a few days to give him the time to get things in order. Although the centre is due for completion in two days’ time, the compound (residential quarters) where we’ll be living is a little further from being finished. As a result, people are spread out over several locations. Some are staying with other NGOs, and others - particularly the soldiers - are staying at Moyamba stadium. Having neither an office, nor an internet connection makes it tricky to get any work done. It’s not proving easy to find somewhere to live. 

We’re looking for a building that will serve as an office, and a guest house. So I’m going to stay put in Freetown a little longer to meet with the other NGOs that are working here and find out as much information as I can before the rest of the team arrives. Because SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL is going to set up camp here, there is a lot to be done in terms of administration. We need to register with the authorities, open a bank account, and so on. It’s not going to be a restful few days!
