After months of training and preparation, the SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL team - consisting of myself, Fanny, and Andrea, our Water, Hygiene and Sanitation specialist - has made it to Freetown to launch our Ebola response.

We arrive in the middle of the night and join the queue for the bus that will take us to the ferry terminal, from which we will take a boat to Freetown’s city centre. There are a lot of people, all packed tightly together. What was that about a "no touch policy", again?

In the boat, it’s difficult to avoid coming into contact with our fellow travellers. We’ll have to adjust; we’ll have to let go of old habits and learn new ones: it’s always this way when you go on a humanitarian mission. But this one is different. Our two-day training session with MSF in Brussels – with its slogan of "No touch/2 meters" - seems light years away after 90 minutes of touch-touch, both in the queue and throughout the boat journey.

Although it’s impossible to respect the security protocol as strictly as we would like to, we finally make it to Freetown, where we manage a few hours of sleep. It’s already 5 in the morning and tomorrow, we have a meeting with our future colleagues from M&eacute;dicos del Mundo Espa&ntilde;a. We will soon be working alongside them at the Ebola care centre, funded by the British government. Perhaps most importantly, we’ll be meeting Julio, the third member of our team, for the first time. Of all of us, he has the most experience of this kind of emergency, having already spent some time working in an ETC in Sierra Leone.
