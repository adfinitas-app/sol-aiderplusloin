The Moyamba care centre is filling up quickly. Every day and every night, the "Holding Centre" sends us patients, and the teams never stop working. There are now 20 patients in the centre, six of whom have been tested positive for Ebola. Of the six, two are well on the road to recovery: a ten-year-old girl, and one of the first patients we received at the centre, a sixty-year-old woman who was very weak when she arrived and who seems to be getting better and better. Both have been tested negative for Ebola - but they’re waiting for the results of a second test before they can leave the centre and go back to their families.

## Isatu is still sick

The other four confirmed cases, however, are still very sick. Isatu - whose baby was able to leave the centre - has been fighting the virus as hard as he can. The mother of the ten-year-old girl tested negative is not very well at all; nor is her four-year-old son. The fourth patient is a pregnant woman who is also in a critical condition. Even with the care and support provided by M&eacute;dicos del Mundo Espa&ntilde;a and SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL, things don’t look good. Among the 14 suspected cases, some are very likely to be confirmed and others less so. Everyone is hoping to see their tests come back negative, but at the same time, we’re prepared for the worst.
