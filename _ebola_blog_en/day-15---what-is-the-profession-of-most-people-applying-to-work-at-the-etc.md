Training for the national staff who’ll work alongside the medical team is in full swing. We’ve been inundated with applications, and they keep coming. It’s important to bear in mind that there aren’t a lot of jobs going in Sierra Leone at the moment. Schools and universities are closed, leaving thousands of teachers and professors out of work. The socioeconomic consequences are significant. Apart from fact that teachers aren’t being paid, schoolchildren are no longer learning, and hundreds of thousands of university students have had to put their studies on hold.

## Stopping the virus in its tracks

Another explanation for the influx of applications is that the Sierra Leonean government has established a system of bonuses for all those working on the Ebola crisis. Anyone working in a care centre receives a huge bonus, which is easily equivalent to twice their salary. People employed to bury bodies receive the same bonuses.

Of course, the main reason that people apply to work in the ETC is because they want to be part of efforts to stop the spread of Ebola. It has already been responsible for too many deaths.
