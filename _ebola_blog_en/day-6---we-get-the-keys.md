We’ve been here for barely a week and with every day that passes, we’re more and more aware of the immensity of the task that awaits us. Although we’re used to working in collaboration with other organisations, it’s never easy. And in this case, there’s such a mixture of cultures: we’ve got a Spanish NGO ([M&eacute;dicos del Mundo Espa&ntilde;a](Médicos del Mundo España)), a French one ([SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL](http://solidarites.org/en/)), plus representatives of [Britain’s National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx), Norwegian doctors and nurses, and Danish specialists who will be responsible for running the centre’s laboratory. All these different people will have to pull together if we’re to meet the mammoth task we’ve set ourselves: to open a functional, safe and secure care centre in just a few days’ time. We’re due to get the keys today. Although this marks the symbolic start of our mission, in reality, there’s still a lot of work to do. We’re not yet ready to take in patients, and there’s not much time left before the centre is due to open. Recruitment of the national team is ongoing: the first 123 of them are currently attending a training session run by the [WHO](http://www.who.int/fr/) in Moyamba. And the centre still needs to be kitted out. We’re lucky that everyone’s motivated and willing to lend a hand, because we’ve got only one week to do what would normally take a month.
