Andrea Angioletti, one of our first two volunteers to go to Sierra Leone, is back in France. After six intense weeks at Moyamba treatment centre, where he was responsible for training and coordinating the hygiene teams, he’s tired. But he’s happy to have had the chance to experience a mission that was so rich in human terms.

"I’m not going on holiday - I’m going to sleep!" he jokes. "We worked an average of twelve hours a day, from eight in the morning until eight or nine at night. But we were always happy to do it. It was our duty to help the patients, and not once did anybody complain about the long days. The atmosphere of the mission was especially good. Everyone got on really well: local and expatriate staff, doctors and hygiene specialists, whether they were Sierra Leonean, French, Spanish or Norwegian. I’d go back, not only for the team spirit but also for the work itself, which is really interesting - and so different from the work we do on other missions. I can’t explain how it felt to see the first survivors dance out of the centre, to songs and applause from the staff. I’ve never experienced anything like it.

Of course, in this type of situation, you also have things that are more difficult to deal with. For me, the biggest challenge was when I had to organise the burial of a six-year-old girl who had lost her fight against Ebola. But it was my job, and I’d do it again."
