Andrea is in Bo, at a care centre run by MSF. After a few days of training in Brussels, he’s now going to experience the reality of what it is to work in a care centre. Once he dons his protective suit, he can no longer afford to make any mistakes. His training session is taking place in a centre that’s already up and running, and the risks are much more real than those he faced in Brussels. But he’s surrounded by a skilled, dedicated team, and he’s already well prepared. ([Find out his interview](http://solidarites.org/en/nos-missions/ebola-sierra-leone/temoignages-sierra-leone/1019-ebola-permettre-aux-medecins-de-travailler-en-toute-securite))

The same day, Julio and our Logistician Emmanuel, along with the MDM Espa&ntilde;a team, are preparing to receive fourteen lorries full of material and supplies, sent from Freetown. They’ll have to unload and store the contents so that everything is ready for the set-up of the centre. It’s something of a Herculean effort: there are no forklift trucks, so we’ll have to do everything by hand. Luckily, everyone’s willing to do their part.
