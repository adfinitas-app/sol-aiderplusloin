Yesterday, for the first time, we had to deal with a tricky situation. Despite the strict health and safety procedures that we all respect, one of the team members working in the high risk zone started to feel sick. He noticed he had a temperature. As soon as he started to feel unwell, he raised the alarm. He was immediately put into isolation. His temperature was slightly over 37.5&deg;, high enough for us to evacuate him to the centre in Kerry Town which is reserved for national humanitarian workers suspected to have contracted Ebola.

Happily, we learnt this morning that his blood tests came back negative. He will nonetheless stay under observation for a few days. Although we’re all relieved to know that he’s okay, it was a positive experience in that it demonstrated that our evacuation procedures were efficient and that everyone knew what they were supposed to do. It also means we won’t become complacent: we’ll always be on our guard, every minute of every day.
