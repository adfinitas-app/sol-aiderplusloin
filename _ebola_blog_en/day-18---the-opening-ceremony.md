Today, the local authorities came to attend the opening ceremony of Moyamba ETC.  The final training sessions have taken place. Now, it’s time to finalise the last few details and make sure the teams are well briefed. You can never be too prepared! Today, we held an official opening ceremony for the centre. The local authorities were invited to attend. Although we won’t be taking in any patients today, we decided to go ahead with the ceremony. 

Below, a picture of the management teams from Doctors of the World Spain and SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL in front of the sign at the entrance of the centre, taken during the ceremony.
