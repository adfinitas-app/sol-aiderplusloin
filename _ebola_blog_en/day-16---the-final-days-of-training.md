The big day is fast approaching. The care centre is due to open in just a few days, and there’s a lot left to do. Getting a centre ready in such a short time is a huge challenge, and one we’ve been facing since we arrived here. And it’s not over yet!

Today is the last day of training for the national staff. And it’s of the utmost importance: the trainers, who are part of SOLIDARIT&Eacute;S INTERNATIONAL’s team, will have to make a final selection among the Sierra Leonean trainees. Unfortunately, in spite of their courage and their very best efforts, not everyone is ready.

## How will we react when the first ambulance pulls up?

This question comes back again and again in the run-up to the opening of the centre. How will our teams react when we get the first call from a holding centre (the place people suspected of having Ebola go to get tested, and where they stay until a space opens up in an ETC)? What will happen when the first ambulance pulls up?

Julio, the manager of our teams in the Moyamba ETC, already has experience of working in a care centre. He tells us how, even with all the training and preparation they’ve been through, some staff were paralysed at the sight of the first ambulance. Nobody knows how they’ll react in this kind of situation.
